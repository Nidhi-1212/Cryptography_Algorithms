RSA Algorithm
The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys).
As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared with anyone.
RSA algorithm is a public key encryption technique and is considered as the most secure way of encryption.
It was invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in year 1978 and hence name RSA algorithm.

AES Algorithm
The AES Encryption algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits. 
It converts these individual blocks using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
Once it encrypts these blocks, it joins them together to form the ciphertext.
